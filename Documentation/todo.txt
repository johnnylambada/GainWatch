TODO
1) Attach new trips class to position.  A class has a linked list of trips.  See the trades.xls spreadsheet for what the trips should have and calculate.

2) At the end of a campaign, dump a .html file that contains the pertiant info.  Put it in c:\gainwatch\results and name it YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.html

3) move the UI logic from GWPositions to it's own class.  This will become the basis for the UI (when I get to it)

4) What's left of GWPositions becomes the Campaign class.  Define what this means.

5) Add ability to pull from multiple zip files at the same time and keep their time in sync
